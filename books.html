                <h3>Asteria: A World Unbound</h3>
                <p>Asteria: A World Unbound is an epic fantasy novel that follows Aaron Aevum, a deadly assassin haunted by a life not entirely his own. Conditioned to kill without question, he's spent years under the iron grip of a shadowy organization. Eventually, however, a mission goes wrong, and death finally catches up to him. 
                But death isn't the end.</p>
                <p>Aaron awakens in a world of magic and ancient bloodlines, reborn into nobility with the skills of his former life intact. Here, power manifests in the form of magic, and survival demands more than just a sharp blade. As he navigates this unfamiliar world of kingdoms, politics, and arcane forces, Aaron is faced with a question he's never had the luxury to ask: "What do I want my life to become?"
                Torn between the ghosts of his past and the possibilities of a new future, Aaron must decide what path he will carve for himself into this new world, but his journey does not come without its trials.</p>
                <p>The first installment in the sweeping, character-driven Asteria Chronicles, an epic fantasy saga.</p>
