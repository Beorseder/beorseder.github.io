      <p>Adam Jaskuloski was born in 2002 in Salt Lake City, Utah. His love for storytelling began at age seven after reading The Lightning Thief, which led to a deep passion for fantasy through series like Fablehaven and Eragon. Though his interest in novels faded during his teenage years, story remained central to the media he consumed—especially in video games.</p>
      <p>Originally pursuing computer programming at the University of Utah, Adam shifted paths during the pandemic, delving into his passion for theater. He studied directing, stagecraft, stage management, and play-writing, which broadened his creative skill set.</p>
      <p>In college, longtime friend Vi Mai approached him with the idea of co-authoring a fantasy novel. Despite early hesitation, Adam joined the project, eventually taking the lead on expanding the world’s systems—developing its cultures, mythologies, and magic. After graduating in 2024, he committed full-time to the world of Asteria.</p>
      <p>Outside of writing, Adam enjoys video games like Final Fantasy VII, anime such as One Piece, and playing piano when time allows.</p>
